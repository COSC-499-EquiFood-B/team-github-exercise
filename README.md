# Array Sort
- This branch features a method called ```arraySort()``` which takes an array as an argument and returns the sorted array.
- The array can be an array of ```int``` or ```char```.
- The file also consists of a JUnit test function called ```testArraySort()``` that tests the above method with 3 test values.
